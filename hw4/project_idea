Project Idea: I am planning to participate in the ACM SIGMOD 2019 programming contest(http://sigmod19contest.itu.dk/task.shtml)
and use the project in this competition as my final project.

The competition is about providing a high performance sorting method in extremely large datasets.

I am planning to use HPC knowledge that we learned from this course to optimize our program.
