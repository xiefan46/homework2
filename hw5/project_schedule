Project: Parallel k-means clustering using CUDA
Notice: In last week I mentioned about another topic.
But later on I found that I am more interested in this topic. So I change my project idea.

Date                                 Work                                                                         Who
4/28 — 4/30                Read books and papers to understand k-means algorithm, understand how to use CUDA      Fan

5/1 — 5/5                  Implement a basic C++ single thread version k-means and verify it.                     Fan

5/5  — 5/12                Modify the previous version to a CUDA version                                          Fan

5/12 — 5/19                Work on presentation slides and report                                                 Fan
